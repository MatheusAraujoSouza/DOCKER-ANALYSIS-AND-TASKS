# The What and Why of Containers

The text explains the advantages of containers in software development and operations.
Containers are essentially an encapsulation of an application with its dependencies, similar to a lightweight form of virtual machines (VMs).
Containers have several advantages over traditional VMs, such as greater efficiency, portability, and the ability to run many containers at the same time.
The purpose of a VM is to fully emulate a foreign environment, while the purpose of a container is to make applications portable and self-contained.
The text compares VMs and containers, with diagrams illustrating the differences in how they operate.
VMs are more trusted and battle-hardened technology, while containers are newer and still gaining trust in some organizations.
