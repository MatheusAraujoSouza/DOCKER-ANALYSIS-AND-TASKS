# the difference between VMs and containers

Think of a VM as a separate house with its own furniture, appliances, and utilities. Each house is completely independent and has its own set of resources, including an operating system and applications.

On the other hand, think of a container as an apartment in a building. All the apartments share the same building infrastructure and utilities, like electricity, water, and heating. Similarly, containers share the same host kernel and libraries, which helps to reduce the resources required and allows for faster startup times.

So, while VMs provide complete isolation, they can be resource-intensive and slow to start up. Containers, on the other hand, provide a lightweight and faster alternative, but with less isolation.

### host, host OS, and kernel:

Host: Think of a host as a house that provides a place for people (applications) to stay. The house has resources like rooms, bathrooms, and a kitchen that can be used by the people staying there. Similarly, a host provides resources like CPU, memory, and storage to applications that run on it.

Host OS: The host operating system can be compared to the manager of the house. The manager is responsible for ensuring that the house is well-maintained, resources are available, and guests are comfortable. Similarly, the host OS is responsible for managing the resources of the host machine and ensuring that applications running on it can function properly.

Kernel: The kernel can be compared to the infrastructure of the house, such as plumbing, electrical wiring, and ventilation. These essential components provide the necessary services to the house, like water, electricity, and air. Similarly, the kernel provides essential services to the operating system and manages hardware resources like CPU, memory, and input/output operations.
