# Real-world analogy for a host machine.

In the context of computing, a host machine can be thought of as the physical server or computer that is responsible for running one or more virtual machines or containers.

An analogy for a host machine could be a hotel. Just as a hotel is a physical building that houses multiple rooms where guests can stay, a host machine is a physical server that houses multiple virtual machines or containers where applications can run.

Just like a hotel provides a set of resources and services to its guests, such as rooms, beds, bathrooms, and amenities, a host machine provides a set of resources and services to the virtual machines or containers it hosts, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network connectivity.

Similarly, just as a hotel can have multiple guests staying in different rooms, a host machine can host multiple virtual machines or containers, each running a different application or service.

I hope this analogy helps to clarify what a host machine is and how it relates to the larger context of computing.
