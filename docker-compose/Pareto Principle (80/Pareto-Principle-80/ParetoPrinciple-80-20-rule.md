<li>
Services: Services are the core building blocks of Docker Compose applications. A service represents a containerized application that is designed to run in isolation from other services. Each service can be defined with a separate set of configuration options, such as ports to expose, volumes to mount, environment variables, and more.

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```
</li>

<li>
Volumes: Volumes are a way to persist data between container restarts and to share data between containers. They allow you to mount a host file or directory as a container volume or create a named volume that can be shared across multiple containers.

```yaml
volumes:
  data:
```
</li>



<li>
Networks: Networks are a way to isolate containers from each other and to define communication between them. They allow you to create a virtual network that connects all the containers in your Docker Compose application and provides a private network for your services to communicate with each other.

```yaml
networks:
  mynetwork:
```
</li>


<li>
Environment Variables: Environment variables are used to pass configuration options to containers at runtime. They can be used to set database connection strings, API keys, or any other configuration options that your application requires.

```yaml
environment:
  - DB_HOST=database
  - DB_USER=user
  - DB_PASS=password
```

Let's say you have a Node.js application that requires a database connection string to connect to a MongoDB database. Instead of hardcoding the connection string in your application code, you can use an environment variable to pass it to the container at runtime. Here's an example Docker Compose file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://mongo:27017/mydatabase
    depends_on:
      - mongo
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./mongo-data:/data/db

```

In this example, we define an environment variable MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING with the value mongodb://mongo:27017/mydatabase. We pass this environment variable to the web service using the environment key. Now, when the web container starts, it will have access to this environment variable and can use it to connect to the MongoDB

Docker Compose Commands: Docker Compose has a set of commands that allow you to manage your Docker Compose application, such as starting and stopping containers, building images, and more.
Example:

```yaml
docker-compose up: starts the Docker Compose application
```

```yaml
docker-compose down: stops the Docker Compose application and removes the containers, networks, and volumes
```
```yaml
docker-compose build: builds the Docker images for the services defined in the Docker Compose file
```
```yaml
docker-compose ps: shows the status of the containers in the Docker Compose application
```
```yaml
docker-compose logs: shows the logs for the containers in the Docker Compose application
```

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://mongo:27017/mydatabase
    depends_on:
      - mongo
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./mongo-data:/data/db
```

To start this Docker Compose application, you would navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file and run the command docker-compose up. This will start the web and mongo containers and create a network for them to communicate on. You can then access the application at http://localhost:3000.
